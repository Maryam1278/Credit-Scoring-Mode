# Credit-Scoring-Mode
This project builds a credit scoring model to predict loan approval using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset includes financial and personal details such as income, CIBIL score, asset values, and loan status. Key features:

- **Loan Status Prediction:** Determines if a loan will be approved or rejected.
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, label encoding for categorical data.
- **Model:** Random Forest, evaluated by accuracy (~98%), precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**How to Run:**
1. Install dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas).
2. Load dataset.
3. Run script to train and evaluate the model.

**Future Work:** Consider other models (e.g., XGBoost) and hyperparameter tuning.
